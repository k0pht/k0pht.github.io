Welcome to my blog! I am an IT Security Consultant, providing technical and strategic guidance to clients, helping them secure their information systems. My role involves designing and implementing secure architectures and configurations, managing vulnerability, and integrating Microsoft Security solutions. 

I love to learn how things works and, according to my wife, I like to be in control; so I have a natural passion for hacking. It turns out that offensive security is, if not the best, the most exciting way to learn about Information Security.

I will use this blog to share what I learn, test and experience on both sides of the purple line.
